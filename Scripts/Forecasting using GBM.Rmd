## Introduction

This project looks at trying to forecast crime rates in Buffalo, NY. The data used for this analysis can be located here:https://data.buffalony.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incidents/d6g9-xbgu . The analysis involves multiple data science practices including, data extraction, data cleaning, model building and model tuning. 

# Libraries Needed
```{Libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(tibble)
library(purrr)
library(rsample)
library(tis)
```

# Reading in the Data

For this particular analysis, I had downloaded the data as an excel file from the buffalony.gov website and saved it in a memorable folder.

```{Data}
crime = read_csv("Data/Crime_Incidents.csv")
```

# Cleaning the Data

There were some minor issues with the data that needed to be fixed. Some dates needed to be corrected, missing values filled in, need consistent formatting throughout a variable.

```{Data Cleaning}

crime_clean = crime %>%
  mutate(address_1 = toupper(address_1)) %>%
  mutate(incident_datetime = mdy_hms(incident_datetime)) %>%
  mutate(incident_type_primary = toupper(incident_type_primary)) %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = str_to_sentence(day_of_week))
```

After the initial round of cleaning, we noticed that there were still some problems. We had some outlier years that needed to be removed,
